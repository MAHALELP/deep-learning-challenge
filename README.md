README for Deep Learning Challenge

Overview
This project involves creating a binary classification model to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations.

Steps

Preprocess Data:
Load charity_data.csv.
Drop EIN and NAME columns.
Encode categorical variables and scale features.
Split data into training and testing sets.

Build and Evaluate Model:
Design a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
Compile, train, and evaluate the model.
Save the model as AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

Optimize Model:
Create a new notebook for optimization.
Apply at least three optimization techniques.
Save the optimized model as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.

Write Report:
Include purpose, results, and a summary.
Address preprocessing, model details, performance, and alternative models.

Submission
Download and save notebooks.
Move to the Deep Learning Challenge directory.
Push to GitHub.
